# folio_solutions

## overview

The hacker folio module is a way to help you
see what I've solved for yourself in a nice
concise collection,
in this case, it's written in `X`, it also
includes notes throughout the project to
give further information.

If you wanna see solutions in some other language
I've used then look around.
